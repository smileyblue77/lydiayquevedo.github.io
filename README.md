# Personal Website Starter Code

Welcome to my webpage! This is a work-in-progress place for me to show off my favorite projects. 

### Project Requirements
Your project should:
- Include one home HTML page that's all about you!
- Include a navigation bar that is included on all your website's pages.
- Include one portfolio HTML page to showcase your projects.
- Have all text, image(s), links, and/or videos on the page contained within appropriate HTML elements.
- Include alt text for every image in your website.
- Apply styles to text, image, and navigation bar elements using CSS rules.
- Use classes and/or IDs to style CSS elements.

### Extensions
You can extend your project further by:
- Customizing the fonts.
- Adding some fancy CSS styles.
- Embedding YouTube videos.
- Adding another page or more content.
